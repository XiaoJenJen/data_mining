Jenny Xu, Daniel Truong, Ti-Tai Wang and MoonSung Kim in 2018 Fall

## Why we do this and what the result is?
* Our goal is to predict the factors in traffic accidents in the case of hit n run. 
* Please see the [project slides](https://github.com/XiaoJenJen/practical_data_mining_project/blob/master/Presentation.pptx) for a thorough understanding and visualization. 

## How we do?
* Programming language:R
* Introduction: data scource, basic statistic summary
* Data Preprocessing: normalize, outlier detection, missing values
* Classification: one hot-coding, SVM, ANN, evaluation
* Clustering: explaination for each catogory, MCA, PAM, OPTICS
